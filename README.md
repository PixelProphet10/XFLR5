# 🛩 XFLR5 Airfoil & Aircraft Design Projects

Welcome to my collection of **XFLR5** aerodynamic design and analysis projects!  
This repository contains various **airfoil, wing, and aircraft performance simulations** created using **XFLR5** for analyzing lift, drag, stability, and efficiency at low Reynolds numbers.

These projects cover areas such as:
- Airfoil geometry analysis
- Wing design and optimization
- Lift & drag performance studies
- Aircraft stability and control evaluation
